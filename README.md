# WifiTest
I made this Wifi tester because the Wifi in my college apartment complex likes to go out frequently. This GUI displays whether the internet is down or, if it is up, it will show the download and upload speeds. This allows the user to leave this program running on their computer and, once the box stating whether the internet is down turns green, they will know that their internet has come back online.
